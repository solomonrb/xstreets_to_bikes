# Citibike Stations via SMS 

Text your current cross streets to 1-844-407-2201, and you will receive a response with the 3 closest Citibike stations and their bike/dock availability!
With a Citibike key and a dumb phone, you no longer need a smartphone with the Citibike app!


## Usage

Send the cross streets you're at in a format that Google Maps would understand, e.g.:
E 27 St and 1 Av Manhattan
Houston St and Macdougal St
12 St and 37 Av Astoria
Vanderbilt and Willoughby Brooklyn

You will receive a text response like:
21 St & 38 Ave has 18 bikes, 0 e-bikes, 0 docks.
36 Ave & 10 St has 10 bikes, 2 e-bikes, 0 docks.
21 St & 36 Ave has 8 bikes, 0 e-bikes, 11 docks.


## How It Works

1. Google Maps geocoding API to return latitude/longitude of inputted cross streets
2. Pull live list of stations from Citibike feed
3. Calculate nearest stations to the inputted cross streets
4. Check bike/dock availability at those nearby stations using Citibike feed

Flask for the app
Twilio for messaging
PythonAnywhere for hosting
MySQL for DB (your phone number is stored in the DB but it is secure and it's just to make sure no one is abusing this and costing me a lot of money!)

## Inspiration

In an effort to reduce my screentime, I recently purchased a dumb phone to use outside of work. 
As an avid Citibiker, I quickly realized knowing Citibike station availability was a crucial part of my smartphone.
Fortunately, I happened to be wanting to build a full project on my own at the same time.

## Future Steps

If you have any updates or ideas, let me know!
For now, everything is totally free and I'm eating a small monthly cost. I assume that will continueâ€”I can't imagine the citibikeNYC x dumbphones intersection is huge!
If you live in another city with a bikeshare system (with a GBFS feed) and are interested in adding your city, let me know. Will do it if there's interest.
I'm considering working on a similar project to get step-by-step directions via SMS, especially since Google Maps recently removed that native feature.
